# InferenceInsights
__InferenceInsights__ offers a detailed comparison of deep learning inference across TensorFlow, PyTorch, and ONNX. We use the same images and a single pre-trained model, conducting tests via FastAPI with uniform configurations. My goal is to provide clear performance metrics, ensuring fair analysis and insights for developers!

## Key Features
__*Uniform Testing Environment*__: I conduct inference using FastAPI with identical configurations for each framework. This setup ensures that differences in performance are attributable to the frameworks themselves, not external factors.

__*Code Consistency*__: I strive to keep the codebase as similar as possible across TensorFlow, PyTorch, and ONNX implementations. This minimizes discrepancies and allows for a clearer assessment of each framework's strengths and weaknesses.

__*Performance Metrics*__: My benchmarks include detailed performance metrics such as latency, throughput, and resource utilization. Visualizations are provided to help interpret the results easily.

__*Documentation and Guides*__: I include comprehensive installation guides to help users set up each framework quickly and efficiently. Example scripts are also provided for running inference with the chosen model.
